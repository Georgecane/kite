# kite

Kite is a programming language designed for Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Audio Processing, written in Zig. Its design emphasizes real-time processing, efficiency, and ease of integration with modern audio workflows.

## Features

- **High Performance:** Built with Zig to deliver fast and reliable DSP and audio processing.
- **Real-Time Capabilities:** Suitable for real-time signal processing with low latency.
- **Modularity:** Supports extensibility with clear, maintainable language constructs.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Designed to leverage GPU resources for computationally intensive audio tasks.

## Design Goals

- **Efficiency:** Provide a lean, performant language for computationally heavy DSP tasks.
- **Expressiveness:** Enable developers to write easy-to-read code that translates directly into high-performance operations.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with existing audio libraries and systems, enhancing traditional DSP workflows.
